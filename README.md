## üí° Why We Built This

As developers, we often need a structured place to publish tutorials, document processes, and share knowledge with the community. We built this system to:

- Provide an organized way to share learning content
- Make it easier for admins to post multimedia-rich tutorials
- Enable users to access tutorials visually and contextually

It also serves as a learning project to understand Laravel concepts such as models, controllers, routes, and views in action.

  - YouTube video link
- Users can contact via the **Contact Us** page (data sent via email)
